Configuration Repository
========================

This repository contains the configuration files of my Arch Linux system.

The files and directories in home/ are to be placed in the user's home
directory.

The files and directories in etc/ are to be placed in the /etc
directory.

Moreover, efibootmgr-output is the output of the current state of the
UEFI variables concerning the boot order. Note that only the first entries
are to be added manually, while the rest are recreated by the Lenovo BIOS
if they are missing.
