# Script to check running against installed kernel and warn the user to
# restart if they differ
#
# This should be quite self-explanatory and be customised to your needs.
#
# Main points for customisation are the constants at the beginning of the
# script.
# - *_template are templates for the lines written to stdout
#
# Requirements:
# - python3 – to execute this script
# - uname – used to get running kernel version
# - pacman – Arch Linux package manager
#   (might be patched to use package managers from other distributions)
